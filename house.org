** Combat
*** Combat Actions
- Can take one minor action (manipulating a lever, shouting a command, etc.) and 1 major action
- A major action is moving and attacking, shooting, or casting a spell.  Note you cannot Shoot and move other than fictionaly close by (I shoot and duck behind the table beside me) but you cannot shoot and move a zone

*** Combat
- The system is based on [phased real-time combat](https://spellsandsteel.blogspot.com/2018/10/phased-real-time-combat-solution-you.html):
**** Orders Phase
Each player outlines what they choose to do on their turn.  DM should play the monsters as monsters.  Dumb monsters, henchmen, etc. should do the obvious thing.  Smart monsters should be smart.  The DM should have a plan prior to what the players come up with (they are free to discuss) and not change the plan based on what they come up with
- The DM hints at monster NPC/actions (unless the players are surprised, in which case the monsters may have a round w/o player actions)
  - if someone is aiming a bow be specific, e.g. a smart henchman aiming a bow at the mage in the second rank
  - dumb monsters glare at who they are going to attack, etc
- Players Declare Actions
  - if the order is not obvious from the fiction of the situation, Melee/Magic declare first, then melee space of weapon, but it really doesn't matter let the players talk amongst themselves
**** Execution Phase
- Interdependent groups are identified
  - There will probably be several discrete combats happening simultaneously
  - Interceptions of movement should be clear, it's not really possible to get around an active combatant unless the fiction obviously allows for it
    - This is how battle lines should come up, e.g. someone should state they are shielding the archer/mage
      + If tthey don't state it and have moved away from them leaving them exposed then such is lif
- Actions are resolved Group by Group
  - Resolve each group entirely before moving on to the next
***** Resolve Ranged First
- If someone has a readied weapon and the fiction allows, resolve the ranged attack first
- If it's not obvious the ranged attack should happen before someone comes in melee w/ the ranged attacker make it an initiative check to see if they get the shot off in time
    - If they do, great, treat them as if they are in simultaneous melee now
    - If they don't, still treat them as if they are in simultaneous melee now
***** Melee is simultanous
- Death happens at the end of the round (unless via a ranged attack or an instantenously cast spell (note: most spells take affect at the end of the round)).  If you are in melee with something and you kill it, it still has had it's attack as well
***** Magic takes affect at the end of the round
- Unless the magic user has spent extra to have an instaneous spell, magic effects happen at the end of the round
***** Conflicts ? Null Events ? Etc
- If something fictionally needs to happen before something else, consider:
  - making it initiative roll to see what happens first, or
  - adding a negative modifier to allow a player or monster to change their plans
**** Chaotic Melee
- If it's truly mass/swarmy conflict have the players and monsters give their battleline JRPG style (front row, backrow)
  - players can't pick their targets (that specific orc) but can select their group (I attack the orcs, not the trolls)
- Apply formation rules as appropriate (provided the size of the combatants is the same)
  - 4 people w/ Formation weapons can form a line against 2 enemies with Lots of Space Required
  - this is the max participants in combat unless some size rules come into play at the GMs discretion
    - E.g. you could end up fighting 6 tiny gnomes even though they are greater than the formation rules allow
    - 2 people with space weapons + 2 people with normal weapons could form a battleline against a particularly huge monster
**** Mass Combat
- group combatants into units as appropriate
- compute total hit points for all units
- damage dealt is multiplied by combat scale
  - not everyone gets an attack in a larger skirmish since not everyone is in contact, terrain plays a role, etc

    | Number | Weapon Damage Mulitiplier | HD 1 | HD2 |  HD4 |  HD4 |  HD5 |
    |--------+---------------------------+------+-----+------+------+------|
    |    2-5 | x3                        |   22 |  45 |   89 |  180 |  360 |
    |   6-10 | x4                        |   45 |  89 |  180 |  360 |  720 |
    |  11-20 | x5                        |   90 | 180 |  360 |  720 | 1440 |
    |  21-40 | x6                        |  180 | 360 |  720 | 1440 | 2880 |
    |  41-80 | x7                        |  360 | 720 | 1440 | 2880 | 5760 |

- When hit, adjust your combat scale
  - Divide the remaining hitpoints by the average points per individual (round up) to see how many are alive
- Player characters are the last to die in a unit
- Spells work as they normally do but at increased cost (consider 1-2 points per multiplier)
- Every unit must make a morale check when:
  - it loses the first member
  - it loses more than 1/2 the mmembers
  - If this is the PCs unit, they can attempt to rally in the next round
- If it fails the morale check it is *broken*
  -  if a broken unit suffers any damge it will rout
    - it will flee the battlefield, any unit(s) in melee range get a free attack with a +2 bonus

*** Combat Ranges
- if playing theater of the mind, use the following modified by description as required:
  - Melee :: in melee range (5 ft)
  - Close/Room :: In the same room (25 ft)
  - Near :: (50 ft)
  - Range :: (75 ft)
  - Far Range :: (100 ft)
  - Use actual range past here you are clearly outside doing something at distance
- Let the fiction guide, players may have a rough battleline so two people can be in melee but one has a reach weapon and is behind the other
  even though there isn't a 10ft Combat Range for the weapon.
- A player can move up to the moverange rating allowed by their encumbrance level
- Movement is simultaneous, so full range of movement may be interrupted
- If moving between zones, cannot move and attack in the same round unless both particpants move towards each other
- Charging
  - Moving 2x zones (modified by encumbrance) takes up an entire round of movement. No combat unless they are also moving towards you
    - This is pure movement closer to running/sprinting
  - Charging 1x zone grants attack with advantage, but -2 Def for the duration of the round (incl. against incoming range attacks)

* Fatigue

 - TODO

* Camp / Forage / Rest sequence

** Rules for short rest
** Rules for Foraging
** Rules for camping
Setting up camp is broken into two phases:
1. Camp Phase
2. Cooking Phase
*** Camp Phase
**** Making Camp
- You can make camp at any time so long as:
  - You are not in conflict or immediate peril
  - You have a place to rest
  - GM allows

- When you make camp it will have a *location* and a *modifier*
- if the camp is obviously sketchy or dangerous just go with that
  - you are camping near an active volcano, in a forest fire, being actively
    hunted, in an enemy town, etc. then you are obviously dangerous
    - if you are in hostile-ish territory, near patrol lines, in a cave you
      can't see the back of that you haven't scouted and there are fresh tracks,
      etc. then you are probably sketchy
      - if you are actively missing most equipment, or your party is huge and
        you are in dangerous territory GM may upgrade sketchy to dangerous
    - if any hirelings failed their morale rolls since ..
      - ?
    - if any hirelings are panicked, attempt to calm them, if you fail:
      - ?
      - camp is sketchy
- if it's not obvious, make it a roll, 2d6 + modifier:
  - Outdoor
    - storm: -4
    - rain/snow/wind/, other inclement weather (freezing, hot, etc.) -2
    - epic day: +1
  - Cave
    - freezing temps/super hot: -2
    - cave is....
      - actually a dungeon - consider upgrading to sketchy to be in the mouth
      - roll 1d20:

**** Camp tables
***** Disaster
- come up some terrible situation (flood, weird biting bugs, hireling with night terror, everyone on edge from being hunted, etc.)
- rest is nigh impossible:
    - remove 1 fatigue to a minimum. of 2, otherwise gain fatigue to 2
    - gain 1d3 hp if you have rations, otherwise 0 hp

*** Cook and Rest phase
- fire? how does this work in a dungeon?
- If you are in good weather with abundant fuel, or travelling in covered wagons (would have a brazier for cooking), ignore this section
- If you are in a dungeon and have a camping stove or material to burn, ignore this section (todo: should this have made the camp phase more sketchy?)
- If you are in a storm and your food requires cooking (unless in a covered wagon or similar), you are out of luck
- Roll 1d6 w/ the following modifiers:
  + If you are in bad weather, add -1 to the roll
    + In bad weasther, can burn 2/3rd a flask of oil, or one bottle of high content alcohol, can negate
  + If you are somewhere with scarce resources, add -1 to the roll
    - can burn 2/3rd a flask of oil, or one bottle of high content alcohol, to negate (stacks with the above)
    + Can be negated by a forage roll prior to setting up camp
  + If no one has a cookpot, -2 to the roll

* Combat
** Sequence
- use these rules https://spellsandsteel.blogspot.com/2018/10/phased-real-time-combat-solution-you.html
* Magic
- Magic Costs 1 - 14 HP
  - progression: 1, 2, d6, d6+1, d6+2, 2d6, 2d6+1, 2d6+2
  - Very powerful magic requires a save (if it fails, it fizzles but you keep your hp)
    - this is d6+2 or above
- If you take damage at any time during the turn, need to save or lose concentration
- A basic spell (cost 1) takes a full turn to cast, targets one create at short range, heals or deals 1 damage.  Increase costs by 1 to 5 points for each:
  - generic wording: e.g. Necromancy vs. Raise Skeleton. The former should cost atleast 1-2 points more
  - instant cast time (takes affect now, not at the end of the round)
  - long range, extra targets, large AOE
  - more damage costs more
  - target w/ more HD than the caster has levels (spells that have no save, for instance)
  - spell duration: longer should cost more
  - using your magic in melee will cost at least 2 more ranks (e.g. a 1 hp spell would become d6)
- Reduce cost for
  - increase spell casting time
  - ingenious use of components
  - completed uner some special circumstances (rituation, location, etc.
