* Items and Encumbrance
** Carrying capacity
- calculation
  - str: 3 +/- str bonus
  - con: 3 +/- con bonus
  - dex: 2 +/- dex bonus (max of -2 or +2)
  - int: 1 +/- int bonus (max of -1 or +2)
  - wis: 0 + wis bonus (max of +2)

- reasoning: want someone with plate (6 slots) + sword + shield to carry only a
bit of inventory.

- alternative (quick): 10 +/- str bonus (max of +2/-2)

*** Combat Ranges
- if playing theater of the mind, use the following modified by description as required:
  - Melee :: in melee range (5 ft)
  - Close/Room :: In the same room (25 ft)
  - Near :: (50 ft)
  - Range :: (75 ft)
  - Far Range :: (100 ft)
  - Use actual range past here you are clearly outside doing something at distance
- Let the fiction guide, players may have a rough battleline so two people can be in melee but one has a reach weapon and is behind the other
  even though there isn't a 10ft Combat Range for the weapon.
* Fatigue

 - TODO

* Camp / Forage / Rest sequence

** Rules for short rest
** Rules for Foraging
** Rules for camping
Setting up camp is broken into two phases:
1. Camp Phase
2. Cooking Phase
*** Camp Phase
**** Making Camp
- You can make camp at any time so long as:
  - You are not in conflict or immediate peril
  - You have a place to rest
  - GM allows

- When you make camp it will have a *location* and a *modifier*
- if the camp is obviously sketchy or dangerous just go with that
  - you are camping near an active volcano, in a forest fire, being actively
    hunted, in an enemy town, etc. then you are obviously dangerous
    - if you are in hostile-ish territory, near patrol lines, in a cave you
      can't see the back of that you haven't scouted and there are fresh tracks,
      etc. then you are probably sketchy
      - if you are actively missing most equipment, or your party is huge and
        you are in dangerous territory GM may upgrade sketchy to dangerous
    - if any hirelings failed their morale rolls since ..
      - ?
    - if any hirelings are panicked, attempt to calm them, if you fail:
      - ?
      - camp is sketchy
- if it's not obvious, make it a roll, 2d6 + modifier:
  - Outdoor
    - storm: -4
    - rain/snow/wind/, other inclement weather (freezing, hot, etc.) -2
    - epic day: +1
  - Cave
    - freezing temps/super hot: -2
    - cave is....
      - actually a dungeon - consider upgrading to sketchy to be in the mouth
      - roll 1d20:
          | result | description   | notes                                                                 |
          |--------+---------------+-----------------------------------------------------------------------|
          |      1 | lair/camp     | inhabited and they are here (convert to next if scouted)              |
          |      2 | lair          | inhabited recently: -2 roll, everyone is on edge                      |
          |    3-5 | uncomfortable | drippy, wet, rocks in the wrong places, wind coming right in, -1 roll |
          |   3-17 | typical       | it's fine                                                             |
          |  18-19 | comfy         | particularly comfy, just the right size for everyone, +1 roll         |
          |     20 | Perfect       | +2 roll                                                               |
          |--------+---------------+-----------------------------------------------------------------------|
  - Dungeon
    - every open, unblocked entrance above one: -2
    - every two blocked entrances: -1
    - within two rooms of combat: -1
    - If you start trying to factor in wandering monsters, heavily trafficked
      areas, factions, hunting parties you are probably onto just being sketchy
  - Hirelings affect this roll
    - no hireling panicked: +1
    - for each panicked hiring: -1 **TODO Define this**

- rest is nigh impossible:
    - remove 1 fatigue to a minimum. of 2, otherwise gain fatigue to 2
    - gain 1d3 hp if you have rations, otherwise 0 hp

*** Cook and Rest phase
- fire? how does this work in a dungeon?
- If you are in good weather with abundant fuel, or travelling in covered wagons (would have a brazier for cooking), ignore this section
- If you are in a dungeon and have a camping stove or material to burn, ignore this section (todo: should this have made the camp phase more sketchy?)
- If you are in a storm and your food requires cooking (unless in a covered wagon or similar), you are out of luck
- Roll 1d6 w/ the following modifiers:
  + If you are in bad weather, add -1 to the roll
    + In bad weasther, can burn 2/3rd a flask of oil, or one bottle of high content alcohol, can negate
  + If you are somewhere with scarce resources, add -1 to the roll
    - can burn 2/3rd a flask of oil, or one bottle of high content alcohol, to negate (stacks with the above)
    + Can be negated by a forage roll prior to setting up camp
  + If no one has a cookpot, -2 to the roll
