% \end{abstract}

\section{Introduction}

These rules are compatable with most OSR products and are not that different
from what you would see in a typical OSR product. The main emphasis of the ruleset is:

\marginnote{Virtual tabletop support exists via a \href{https://foundryvtt.com/}{FoundryVTT module}}

\begin{enumerate}
\item Archetypes (fierce, skilled, weird) that require a discussion between the GM and the players for how abilities work,
  under what conditiosn they apply, so that every character feels fresh and players can capture unique characteristics
  in play. This is the spirit of Whitehack.
\item Classes based on these Archetypes so new characters can be quickly created. The option to roll your own entirely
  based on the Archetype always remains possible. This is the spirit of GLOG.
\item Non-vancian magic system, with magic words and phrases to be used for inspiration for discussion between GM and
  player for spell effect, cost, etc.
  \marginnote{\textbf{Spells and other supernatural abilities cost HP} and using powerful arcana is another resource
    and set of tradeoffs to be managed by the players. The cost is based on the effect, and the HP loss represents
    mental and physical strain, danger, loss of life force, or whatever else the GM and players come up with define
    how magic works in their game world. Hack your magic.}
\item \href{https://spellsandsteel.blogspot.com/2018/10/phased-real-time-combat-solution-you.html}{Phased Simultaneous Combat}
  theater of the mind combat rules including JRPG-style battlelines. My early RPG playing was heavily influenced by PBTAs and
  I always enjoyed the free form combat but hated the looseness of it. This is an attempt to stay OSR with quick combat,
  but re-capture some that flavour.
\item A focus on low level play (after level 5 players get stronger but don't gain any new skills)
\item Slot based encumbrance where items matter but bean counting sucks
\item Because items matter, hirelings are important
\item Because hirelings are important, you need to manage them
  \marginnote{\textbf{Hirelings are important!}: porters, torch bearers, mercenaries, carters all cost money but the characters
    need them to get around and keep the players alive. No one is running around the countryside in full plate mail, cookpots,
    tents, torches, and rations.  Because death comes easy in OSR, these hirelings are likely the source of many of your next characters.}
\item A lightweight camping and resting system, where perilous camp sites have consequences, and items, food, and hirelings matter --seeing a theme here?
\item A lightweight town, resupply, and revelry system
\end{enumerate}
\clearpage
\section{\index{Character}Character Creation}
\label{sec:charactercreation}

\marginnote{A short summary for players:
  \begin{enumerate}
  \item roll for your six attributes
  \item choose your class
  \item ... todo ...
  \item buy equipment
  \end{enumerate}
}

\newthought{Roll 3d6 in order} for your \index{Attributes}attributes.

\marginnote{When using \emph{ranged weapons}, the damage you roll
  remains unchanged. This is good for weak characters and bad for
  strong characters.

\bigskip\noindent Each score comes with a \index{Bonus}bonus:
\smallskip

\begin{tabular}{cc}
Score & Bonus \\
3 & -3 \\
4–5 & -2 \\
6–8 & -1 \\
9–12 &  \\
13–15 & +1 \\
16–17 & +2 \\
18 & +3
\end{tabular}
}

\key{Strength}: allows you to hit harder and carry more. Add the
bonus to your damage rolls when using \emph{melee weapons}. Roll under Strength
to open doors, tear apart chains, or climb a cliff.

\key{Dexterity}: Roll under Dexterity to dodge traps, leap over obstacles, or
perform delicate tasks under pressure. A character's Defense and Stealth are modified
by their Dexterity Bonus. It also affects how coordinated you are while loaded down
with your inventory.

\key{Constitution}: Roll under Constituition to resist fatigue, drowning,
and poison (add positive bonus to your Save for these kinds of throws). It affects your stamina when loaded down with your inventory.  A character's
hitpoints are based on their Constitution.

\key{Intelligence}: Roll under intelligence to solve difficult puzzles, read obscure texts,
or identify items and treasure. If you have a positive bonus it indicates how many
extra language you speak. Bonuses aslo apply to how spatially organized you are with your
inventory.

\key{Wisdom}: Roll under wisom to see through lies, spot hidden dangers, and avoid mind
altering spells(add positive bonus to your Save for these kinds of throws). Wisom affects how many extra slots of flavours a character may have.

\key{Charisma}: Roll under Charisma to flatter, beguile, or barter. Charisma determines how well other mortals \hyperref[key:Reaction
  Roll]{react} to you, how many \hyperref[sec:retainers]{retainers and
  pets} will follow you (2 + your bonus) and their
\hyperref[key:Morale Check]{morale} (7 + your bonus), and can influence resupply rolls.

\newthought{Associated attributes}

\key{Attack}: Your attack rating. Starts at 9, 10, or 11 depending on the archetype.

\key{Defense}: Your defense rating. Starts at 10 and is modified by dex bonus and/or armour.

\key{Stealth}: How stealthy you are. Starts at 5 and is modified by your dex bonus and armour. Some armours make it very hard to be stealthy.

\key{Save}: How lucky you are. Starts at 5 + Cha bonus.  If an effect, challenge, attack, etc. doesn't fall under another category use this
as the fallback.  This represent's the characters luck and determination to resist the cruel hand of fate.

\key{Slots}: How much you can carry. Your hands count as two slots. The amount can be modified by your \textbf{fatigue}. It is calculated by the sum of the following:

\marginnote{You have two \textbf{Quick slots} representing your hands.
  The remaining slots are \textbf{Regular slots}. Anything in a regular
slot takes 1 round to fish out.}

\begin{tabular}{lcr}
  Ability & Value & Notes \\
  Strength & 3 & Strength bonus (-3 to +3) \\
  Constitution & 3 & Constituition bonus (-3 to +3) \\
  Dexterity & 3 & Dexterity bonus (-2 to +2) \\
  Intelligence & 1 & Intelligence bonus (-1 or +1) \\
  Wisdom & 0 & Wisdom bonus (0 to +2)\\
\end{tabular}

\newthought{Choose your \index{Class}class}.

Classes in \textbf{Burnabarian} are based on three archetypes. Pick something from the class section
or use these templates, and the class list for examples of how to hack your game world to fit
what you like. Don't be afriad of making a character too weak or too powerful; you can always
adjust that at the table with your players.  Classes \textbf{TODO LINK TO CLASS SECTION FOR EACH ARCHETYPE} are based off one of the following three archetypes. You don't play this archetype
directly but it is the blueprint behind the class.

\key{Fierce} You can fight well; you can wear the heaviest armour; you have special
combat abilities for you and your hirelings; this is the implest character to play.

\key{Skilled} You rely on superior technique and training to do things in the world. You
often roll with \emph{Advantage} when doing something within your wheel-house and in certain
situations you are even gauranteed success. You can do things that almost look like magic; however, they are not magical and are possible only because of intense training, upbringing, or other reason. This is the most open-ended class and the hardest to define, requiring a dialogue
between the GM and player(s) for what should and should not be possible. The classes for
this archetype are more like broad strokes that need to be filled in and customization is not only encouraged but required.

\key{Weird} You break the rules of the universe. They call you Alchemist; Scientist; Witch; Sorceror; Demon; Cursed. You have the least amount of hitpoints but you are capable of
extraordinary wonders, provided you are willing to pay the cost.

\bigstep
Archetypes broadly define the type of character you have. \marginnote{\textbf{Archetype mixing}
is encouraged when hacking classes! You could have a weird fighter in order to model some
sort of battle warrior
that may be weak but augments themselves with powerful combat magic.}
Besides setting the Hit Dice and Attack value for each class, each archetype has the following:

\key{Abilities}: The number of abilities the player has. These could be combat abilities,
attunements (skilled), or number of magic words/phrases known.

\key{Flavours}: Descriptive relationships (race, careers, offiliations, history, literal relationships) associated with one or more character stats

Gaining a new \textbf{flavour is automatic}; however, gaining \textbf{a new ability requires time}, training, and
money and needs to work with the fiction of the class, game, and or campaign. This should be worked out
between the GM and player. It should not be hard for a character to achieve this if it is aligned
with the fiction; if it is outside of the fiction, a quest or similar may be appropriate in order
to achieve it.

\newpage

\newthought{Roll for hit points}\index{Hit Points} and apply your
constitution bonus. Fierce roll 1d8, deft roll 1d6, and weird roll 1d6.

\marginnote[-3em]{When gaining a level, reroll one die per level. Add
  your constitution bonus to every level. A die can not be reduced
  below 1. Keep your old hit points if the new result is lower.}

\newthought{Roll 3d6 \texttimes 10~coins}. Buy some
\hyperref[sec:equipment]{equipment} using this
\index{Gold!Initial}coins. For example:

\begin{enumerate}
\item rations for a week
\item armour, shield and
  helmet\marginnote{More money for retainers if you are playing a
    skilled or weird}
\item a melee weapon
\item a ranged weapon (a sling if necessary)
\item a light source (or several)
\item to explore: one of rope, pole, or spikes \& hammer
\item to fight monsters: one of torches \& flasks of oil, mirror,
  stakes \& hammer, or wolfsbane
\item use the remaining money to hire retainers and equip them
\item and don't forget something to cook with and sleep in
\end{enumerate}

A skilled player is strongly defined by their description, and are broadly the only class that
gains additional descriptions which can be objects (grandfather's sword, a necromancer's skull,
stolen lockpicks of the Grand Visier, a person from their past, an upbringing, etc.).
When a skilled archetype has advantage, it may trade it's double advantage roll for a double
damage roll if the combat situation is aligned with their description. When doing something
aligned with their abilities, hard tasks should succeed automatically while nigh impossible
tasks, well described by the player, should require a standard roll.  Switching active
and inactive abilities requires a days undisturbed training.

A skilled character cannot use a shield or wear armour heavier than studded leather.
If they do, they lose their abilities and special rolls. They have -2 Attack with any two-handed
weapon (including the longbow) that is not their specialty.

\subsection{\index{Weird}Weird Archetype}

\begin{tabular}{lrlccccc}
  Level & Experience & HP & Attack & Save & Active Abilities & Inactive Abilities & Flavours \\
  1 & 0 & Con - 3  & 10 & 6 & 1 & 1 & 2 \\

  8 & 100,000  & +d4 & 14 & 9 & 4 & 4 & 4 \\
\end{tabular}

\midstep\noindent Weird abilities are worked out on a per situation basis and should be
kept in a log to keep a consistent world. A word or a phrase can be present in an ability.
Switching active and inactive abilities requires a days undisturbed training.

A weird character pays double HP for weird abilities if wearing chain mail and
above or using a shield. A wise character cannot use 2H weapons or ranged weapons other
than the quarterstaff and musket.

\subsection{\index{Descriptions}Flavours and Descriptions}

A new character has two flavours (things that define them) and one of these must be their
fundamental description. The description could be a vocation, career, life purpose, etc.
Flavours give characters broadly defined skills and backgrounds that may become useful or
relevant during the adventure.  Having a flavour associated with a task being attempted
gives beneficial rolls, and in some instances may be required to even attempt the task.

\subsection{Encumbrance}

A character or hireling cannot carry the world. Inventory management is part of the game
and if a character can't carry everything they need then they will have to do without
or hire someone to carry it for them.



\section{Classes}

\section{The Rules of the Game}
\label{sec:basicrules}

todo intro...

\key{Player}: The people sitting at the table (physical or virtual)

\key{Player Character}: The people we’re playing.

\key{Experience Points}: Defeating opponents grants
a small amount of experience point. More experience is gained by \textbf{spending money}
you gained on adventures. You don't get much experience for mundane items such
as selling weapons, and items. Only truly interesting loot that is donated to temples,
erecting a statue, building a business, building an estate, retainers who work for you, and so
on. Let's not fool ourselves that murderhobo adventuring is not part of the OSR tradition.
Loot for XP doesn't count until it's brought back to town safely. If a character wasn't present
for at least some significant portion of an adventure, they probably shouldn't get the XP
for it. Consider rewarding XP for travel, exploration, and ingenuity as well. Handle new characters joining the table however seems fair for your table.

\key{Level}: As time passes, characters hit better, get better saving
throws and gain hit points. They \emph{gain a level}.

\key{Hit Points}: Hit points indicate your condition, endurance, luck, and fortitude.
and will to live

\key{Hit Dice}: For players, this is their level. For NPCs this is approximately how
skilled or dangerous they are. This system assumes 1 HD = 1D6
\marginnote{If converting material from other OSR games that use 1D8 or more for the monster HD
  consider downgrading to 1D6. Weapons generally cause 1D6 damage only, so don't forget to also
downgrade monster attack damage as appropriate.}

\key{Saving Throw}: When in danger from poison, some magical effects, and other
situations you are sometimes granted a saving throw in order to avoid negative effects
or to reduce the damage taken. Spell or monster descriptions should explicitly state
if saving throws apply. To make it, one must roll under the appropriate stat. If no stat seems
to apply, use the generic Save derived attribute.

\subsection{Kinds of Rolls}

\subsection{Skills}

\subsection{Advancement}

\section{Encounters}

\subsection{Combat}



\section{Magic}

\key{Minor} cantrips from GLOG...should be free

\key{Major} todo..spells as we know them

\key{Ritual} magic is grand miracles on a large scale. The destruction of a castle,
splitting of seas, raising of the recently dead, causing a volcano to erupt etc. This type
of magic requires days of preparation, expensive and rare ingredients probably requiring
a quest of their own if the ritual is particularly powerful. There is a significant risk to
the caster. The HP cost is permanent; save reduces HP by half (round up).


\section{Hirelings}

\section{Property and Finance}

\section{Exploration}

\marginnote[-4em]{\key{Reaction Bonus}: Roll 2d6 + the charasma bonus of the most visible party member.
  If the monsters are intelligent, use the following:

  \medskip
  \begin{tabular}{cl}
    2d6	& They will… \\
    2 & attack you \\
    3 & rob you \\
    4 & threaten you \\
    5 & make demands \\
    6 & refuse to cooperate \\
    7 & be skeptical \\
    8 & be wavering \\
    9 & only take safe bets \\
    10 & cooperate \\
    11 & be friendly \\
    12 & be helpful \\
\end{tabular}

  Otherwise:

  \medskip
  \begin{tabular}{cl}
    2d6	& They will… \\
    2 or less & attack you \\
    3 - 7 & May attack if victory likely \\
    8 - 11 & Stand their ground \\
    12 & Move on  \\
\end{tabular}

}

\medskip\key{Reaction Roll}: The referee will make a reaction roll for
almost all creatures characters talk to. Roll 2d6 and add the
\emph{reaction bonus} of the person doing the talking. If you don't
share a common \index{Languages!Reaction Roll}language, apply a -2
penalty. Typically a result of 5 or lower is considered a negative
outcome and a result of 9 and higher is considered a positive outcome.

\key{Morale Check}: Player characters must never check morale.
Everybody else must make a morale check when losing the first member
of their unit and another one when having lost half their unit's
members. The referee rolls 2d6 and compares it with the unit's morale:
if the roll came up higher, that unit breaks and flees. A unit with a morale
of 12 is either too loyal or too singleminded to flee. A unit must
make at most two morale checks per fight. Mercenaries hired by
characters must make morale checks when suffering losses.
